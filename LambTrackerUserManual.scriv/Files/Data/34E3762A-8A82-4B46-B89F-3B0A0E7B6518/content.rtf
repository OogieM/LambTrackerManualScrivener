\f0\fs28 \cf0 LambTracker is designed so that it is relatively easy to modify to handle other species. Specifically the gestation length, EBV age range data and sex table will need modifications. The evaluations and other things will also be important to change. \
Most of the information about headers and labels is located in the Strings section for ease in translation to another language. \
