<p class="itemTitle">January</p>
<p class="itemText">January on the farm is one of the slower times of the year. Once the primary breeding period has passed all the rams are removed from the ewe bunch. Caitlin and Keith typically keep their flock away from rams for two weeks to ensure they can easily identify the sire of all lambs. Depending on your flock requirements you may choose to increase or decrease the time between primer and backup breeding periods. </p>

<p class="itemTitle">March</p>
<p class="itemText">March starts the busy season again. The ewes will start lambing in late April with most of the lambs being born in May. Before lambing the ewes need annual booster shots, their feet need trimming and of course the annual shearing. </p>
<p class="itemText">LambTracker is designed to help with all these traditional recurring sheep management tasks. </p>

<p class="itemText">Lambing Time!</p>
<p class="itemText">May is when the big rush of lambs arrive. In their flock most ewes lamb within the first three weeks of lambing so it can be a bit busy. </p>

<p class="itemText">The last of the lambs are born in June. A pedigree flock must keep accurate records of the sire of each and every lamb. Keith and Caitlin also want to ensure that every ewes has at least two rams to mate with in a given year. To maintain the sire data the rams are separated in time. </p>
<p class="itemText">The last of the ewes who have not lambed are sorted out from the main lambing bunch and put in a separate pasture. Any ewes who fail to lamb are scanned and an alert put in to mark them for slaughter la...</p>

<p class="itemText">LambTracker is helpful to set up breeding of a pedigreed flock. LambTracker Desktop can be used to print pedigrees and data on each potential sire and on all the ewes to be bred. The shepherd can select the matings based on any criteria that he or she normally uses. </p>

<p class="itemText">December started very cold and snowy. The ewes had been sorted into breeding groups and the primary breeding rams were put in. Keith and Caitlin don’t normally use any raddle marker or breeding harnesses on their rams but they do watch them to see if breeding activity is going on. The primary ram was actively breeding his ewes within minutes. </p>

<p class="itemTitle">Notes vs alerts</p>
<p class="itemText">Within the LambTracker system there is the concept of an Alert for a sheep and a Note for a sheep.</p>
<p class="itemText">Alerts are items that need to be looked at the next time you catch or handle the sheep. If there is an alert set for the sheep then you cannot get to the main activity or record in any given module until you acknowledge the alert. Alerts can be set before doing a sheep task. If a sheep have an alert and another alerts is added the text is just appended to the previous alert. </p>

<p class="itemTitle">First Steps</p>
<p class="itemText">Before you start implementing LambTracker we suggest you take some time to decide whether you even need it. Nearly every flock will require at least some sort of record keeping. Depending on your needs you may be best served by keeping a simple paper notebook. There are many cases though where the extensive records that can be easily kept in LambTracker will be useful. </p>
<p class="itemText">To help you determine whether LambTracker would be useful you should answer these questions. </p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I know or need to know the sire ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">EID Not Required</p>
<p class="itemText">LambTracker does not require that you use electronic identification on your sheep. All LambTracker modules can be accessed using a farm, or federal id or by name if you know all of your sheep. </p>
<p class="itemText">However, if you wish to implement EID in your flock you will be able to take advantage of much faster selection of sheep records when you are working within a module. </p>
<p class="itemText">There are a number of EID tags available for sheep at a variety of price points. Most of the tags available in the Unites States are fairl...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Desktop Set-Up</p>
<p class="itemText">LambTracker Desktop is the software package that is used to create and set up the handheld for use in the field. It is also the package that allows you to create various reports to access your flock data. </p>
<p class="itemText">The general concept is that you set up your defaults and predefined items, select the tasks you plan to do on the handheld and download the current data set and the tasks to the handheld. </p>
<p class="itemText">Once you have finished with the sheep tasks any data you have collected during the task are synced back t...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Convert to EID</p>
<p class="itemText">Once a flock owner has decided to convert the flock to using electronic id there is a lot of set up that needs to be done.</p>
<p class="itemText">If the flock owner want to have a very accurate and complete database then all the existing tag numbers and identification should to be added to the database. </p>
<p class="itemText">Depending on your flock needs LambTracker supports keeping a full lifetime history of all previous identification types as well. </p>
<p class="itemText">The defaults for sheep id types include:</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Evaluate Sheep</p>
<p class="itemText">One of the common tasks for any shepherd is deciding which sheep to cull. Some flocks will cull entirely based on age, others may evaluate sheep checking the three T’s of sheep (teeth, toes and tits or testicles) and culling any individual who falls short in one of these three critical criteria. </p>
<p class="itemText">Other flocks may set up elaborate sheep evaluations, scoring a number of both commercially important and breed characteristic traits and giving each sheep a combined score that represents the relative p...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Modifications for Other Species and Languages</p>
<p class="itemText">LambTracker is designed so that it is relatively easy to modify to handle other species. Specifically the gestation length, EBV age range data and sex table will need modifications. The evaluations and other things will also be important to change. </p>
<p class="itemText">Most of the information about headers and labels is located in the Strings section for ease in translation to another language. </p>
